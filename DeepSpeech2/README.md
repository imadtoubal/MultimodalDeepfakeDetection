# deepspeech.pytorch

Implementation of DeepSpeech2 for PyTorch. The repo supports training/testing and inference using the [DeepSpeech2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595v1.pdf) model. Optionally a [kenlm](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) language model can be used at inference time.

This uses the model as provided by [SeanNaren](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch)

## Pre-trained models

Pre-trained models can be found under releases [here](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch/releases).
